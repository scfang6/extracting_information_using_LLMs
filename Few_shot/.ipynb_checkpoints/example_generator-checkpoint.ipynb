Since I last saw him in clinic at end of May he has had further shaking attacks, although again these do have some unusual features and do not appear typically generalised tonic-clonic seizures.\\n\\nHis EEG took place on 7th June 2016.  This did show some sharp and slow waves over the both temporal lobes, mainly on the right but occasional spike and wave complexes seen over the left posterior region.  \\nCombined with his history it was felt that this EEG has just a liability towards focal seizures.  \\nIn view of this I have therefore given him a prescription for the antiepileptic drug, Levetiracetam.  I have prescribed 250 mg at night for two weeks and 500 mg at night for the next two weeks and then 500 mg twice a day thereafter.  \\nI will continue to monitor him to see how he is managing on this medication.

Catherine is a 57-year-old lady who has been seen in the Neurology and Epilepsy Departments at Kings for many years.  She has quite complex epilepsy along with mental health issues.  The referral was to comment on the possibility of her having an underlying cerebral vasculitis to account for her symptoms.  On the EPR system at Kings, there is an MRI scan from May 2007 and a more recent scan from September 2013; however there was an MRI scan report from February 2000; although no actual images were available from these scans.  In the scan report from the year 2000 there is a comment upon changes on previous scans from the 90\\x92s.  All these scans show multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity within the cerebral white matter.  These are in subcortical and periventricular locations.  Whilst there may have been a minimal increase in these changes over time, the change has not been dramatic.  Whilst the imaging changes are nonspecific, they are most likely in keeping with small vessel ischaemic change.  She has never had any stroke like episodes.\\n\\nShe smokes 12 cigarettes per day and has done for a number of years.  Her blood pressure was 112/86 today.  She is not known to have diabetes.\\n\\nHer current medication consists of Aspirin, Haloperidol, Lacosamide, Phenytoin and Sodium Valproate.  She denies drug allergies.  There is no family history of hypertension, diabetes or any arthrosclerotic disease.\\n\\nOn examination today, her eyes were bloodshot and tearing quite readily during the consultation.  I understand she has been seen by the eye doctors who could find no major ocular abnormality.  She had a postural tremor in her arms probably related to the Sodium Valproate but otherwise I could find no abnormality on cranial nerve and limb examination.  She was fully alert during the consultation and gave a reasonable account of her neurological problems.\\n\\nWhilst the patient does have mental health problems which may be linked to the underlying epilepsy there has never been any neurological event affecting the cranial nerve or limbs.  Furthermore the vascular changes on MRI scans are not that impressive and have not change dramatically over a long period of time.  Overall, I think it is highly likely that the MRI changes are subclinical and related to her smoking.  At the present time I would not advocate lumbar puncture and forms of cerebral angiography.  Clearly, this opinion may change if her clinical features alter considerably.\\n\\nMany thanks for asking me to review this very interesting case.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\n\\nDr Weeks PhD FRCP\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\n\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr Robert Weeks PhD FRCP\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8335\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered on 15 May 2014 by Nma Nzekwu (Secretary)\\nPage 2 of 2 \\n\\nCatherine Boyd   F112261 NHS No: 6291329476\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

We are rather running out of other second line medications and I have suggested Perampanel as above.  This has been available for about two years and I think does have an important place here as an add on treatment in seizures.  It can cause irritability or mood changes and also weight gain.  It can also produce dizziness it needs to be taken last thing at night when getting into bed.  The top dose is said to be the order of 10 to 12 mg at night.  I will ask the nurse specialist to get in touch with him in two or three months\\x92 time to check how the changes are going.  The plan will be if he tolerates the initial changes as above to keep increasing Peramapanel and cutting back the Topiramate.\\n\\nHe feels that further surgery is not the first port of call and he felt that the quoted seizure freedom rate of 60% was not particularly good.

Although the addition of Levetiracetam appears to have to some extent helped his epilepsy, in that he has not had any convulsions since he started on it and in that the severity of his partial attacks is less, this appears to be at an unacceptable price.  Sam has noticed that since he started it he has been more anxious.  In an e-mail in October he reported:\\n\\x93I have noticed recently slightly odd feelings of anxiety \\x96 or, rather, the experience manifestations of anxiety without its content, if that is coherent.  Said another way, I feel to all intents and purposes anxious but cannot identify anything particular I am anxious about.  This feeling is mild but fairly constant \\x96 except when my mind is occupied by something more compelling.  Sometimes, of course, I do have a genuine worry which I can match up with the feeling, but I do not feel those worries cause the feeling because it is there with or without them (it continued through a very relaxing holiday!).\\x94\\nSeizures: these are partial and occur once every two weeks.  During them he does not lose awareness but loses his ability to speak and sometimes understand what is said.  They last about 30 seconds to a minute.\\n\\nPlan: It is likely that Levetiracetam is contributing to the feeling of anxiety described above.  I asked him to reduce the dose from 125mg a day to 125mg every other day for a couple of weeks then discontinue it.  He prefers not to have side effects even at the expense of more seizures.  However, we should try and control his epilepsy better.  We discussed the options.\\n\\nWe could consider adding and perhaps gradually changing to another sodium channel blocker such as Lamotrigine or Lacosamide.  He was a little wary of Lamotrigine which can cause insomnia as his sleep is currently \\x91not wonderful\\x92 although he drinks a lot of coffee.  He has never tried sodium valproate and although his epilepsy is focal it may be idiopathic and it is worth considering.  Pregabalin might be beneficial as an add-on, especially that Pregabalin has an antianxiety effect.  There are of course others that could be considered such as Topiramate and Zonisamide etc.\\n\\nWe have today opted for Pregabalin to replace Levetiracetam as add-on treatment and for him to continue on slow release Carbamazepine.  I gave him a prescription to take at 25mg a day for a week then 25mg twice a day.  If he is comfortable on this, the dose can gradually be increased.  The maximum licensed dose is 300mg twice a day.  Weight gain can occur.  Giddiness may also occur.  I asked him to make contact when he is on 25 twice a day to let me know how he is getting on with it and we can increase the dose further as needed.\\n\\nI have asked for a routine appointment but Sam will keep in touch in between.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nChecked Electronically\\nDr Nashef MD FRCP\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr L Nashef MD FRCP\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8347\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8341\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered on 28 November 2013 by Cheryl Straughan (Medical Secretary)\\nPage 2 of 2 \\n\\nSam Block F244997 NHS No:4388523879\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

I saw him today with his mother.  I note that Andrew is now 33 and lives with his parents.  His mother tells me that he was born by emergency caesarean section due to cord around the neck.  He had foetal distress.  Although subsequently early motor milestones were normal, his speech was much delayed and he did not speak until about the age of five and needed speech therapy.  Subsequently although he went to mainstream school he was statemented and needed support.  His epilepsy began at the age of 22, initially with a few generalised tonic clonic seizures.  Epilim was started but this did not help.  Subsequently he was tried on Carbamazepine and subsequently Keppra and Oxcarbazepine which both seemed to have helped.\\n\\nHis attacks, however, changed and he currently gets attacks without warning.  When sitting on the chair he will start writhing and moving his limbs around.  During this time he is unresponsive.  This can last about 30 seconds to a minute but his period of unresponsiveness and confusion after that can last longer.  He also has episodes when he can suddenly stop and stare for a short while and third type of episodes can be where he can stop and then turn around and he can be unresponsive and make funny automatisms.\\n\\nThe description of the attacks indeed sounds like complex partial seizures.  The nature of the attack suggests that they may be extratemporal in origin.  There are no clearly localising features all indeed lateralising features.\\n\\nI note that the home video telemetry has shown very abnormal EEGs with right and left-sided epileptiform discharges.  The EEG was notably abnormal.  I understand an MRI scan done at Woolwich is reported not to have picked up any abnormality.\\n\\nAndrew\\x92s mother also reported problems with anxiety and that he may be on the autistic spectrum disorder.\\n\\nPlan of Action:\\n\\n1.\\nI would be grateful if you would start him on Lacosamide with a view to improving his seizure control.  Lacosamide should be started in the dose 25 mg at night for one week and increased by 25 mg every week up to 50 mg twice a day.  If Lacosamide is better tolerated and will control his attacks, on the next visit we can consider reducing Oxcarbazepine\\n\\n2.\\nI would be grateful if you would refer Andrew locally to Medlife Services for autism evaluation\\n\\nI have made another appointment to see him four months\\x92 time when I shall evaluate the benefit achieved with Lacosamide.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically checked and signed\\n\\nDr Nandini Mullatti DM FRCP\\nConsultant Clinical Neurophysiologist\\nPS: I have reiterated safety aspects.

He attended with his grandfather as usual.  Tom is continuing to take  1 g twice a day of Keppra and has no side effects on this dose.  By and large seizures are well controlled on this dose and he has seizures once every six months or so.  He had seizures in November following a period of excessive drinking associated with his birthday and he has had seizures again a couple of weeks ago when once again he was drinking quite a lot over Christmas and New Year.\\n\\nWe had a long discussion about him taking medication regularly, limiting his alcohol to two to three units at a time and sleeping adequately.  Tom has agreed that he will text his grandfather every day once he takes his medication and at the end of two weeks, drop a note to my secretary on 02032 998339 to inform me whether he has had further seizures.  Follow-up six months.\\n\\n  Tom was annoyed that his grandfather was ringing him often to remind him to take medication and this is his alternative strategy for Tom to take charge of his medication and to let his grandfather know when he has taken it so that we can have a clear monitoring period of how regularly Tom is actually taking his medication.

I have reassured Ms Anderson that there is no evidence of a sinister underlying cause for her symptoms\\n\\n2.  Advised to use simple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg Ibuprofen, Nurofen) for her headache\\n\\n3.  Discharged from this clinic, no further follow up required\\n\\nMany thanks for referring this 26-year-old right handed mother of two to Dr Stanton\\x92s General Neurology Clinic. Ms Anderson woke up with a dull left-sided occipital headache on the morning of 14th January 2017 which was constant, 6/10 severity, without any postural component. There was no associated nausea or photo- or phono-phobia. Prior to this she had been systemically well, but in the preceding week had suffered deterioration in her mood with high levels of stress. The headache persisted unchanged for the next two days and on the 17th January she also noticed gradual development of tingling paraesthesias in the left arm over a number of minutes.  This left arm paraesthesia has remained static since that time. She saw you on that day and I understand you diagnosed possible migraine and prescribed both Co-codamol and Sumatriptan 50 mg tablets, neither of which have had any impact upon her headache. Her symptoms remained unchanged and two days later she also developed gradual onset of tingling paraesthesia in the left leg. At this point she attended our A&E Department where she had a CT brain scan with contrast, which did not show any new concerning changes, only stable appearances of the old left parietal scar. She also had a full set of blood tests including FBC, U&E, liver function tests, thyroid function test, bone profile, all of which returned normal results.  She was subsequently discharged and referred to this clinic.\\n\\nIn the two weeks following her A&E attendance her headache has remained unchanged in character and severity, although has occasionally shifted to the right side of the head or to the centre. Paracetamol has given some relief. The paraesthesia in the left leg dissipated the day after she was discharged from A&E. However, the paraesthesias in the left arm have remained constant. There have not been any symptoms of weakness, visual disturbance, speech disturbance, or injection or lacrimation of either eye at any point. There are no other neurological symptoms.\\nWith regard to Ms Anderson\\x92s seizures she has been fully compliant with her Lamotrigine and has not had any seizures for the last six years.\\n\\nPast medical history and current medications are as above. Her only allergy is to Penicillin which has caused a rash. Ms Anderson is a full time mother with children aged 4 years and 1 & 1/2 years.  She currently smokes 10 cigarettes a day but does not drink. She does not drive.\\n\\nExamination: \\nCranial nerves 1 - 12 were all intact. Visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/7 in the left. Fundoscopy revealed normal discs bilaterally with no evidence of papilloedema. In the limbs tone, power, coordination, reflexes and sensation to both pin prick and vibration sense were normal throughout all four limbs. Blood pressure today was 139/82 mm Hg and pulse was 98 and regular.\\nConclusions & Recommendations: \\nI have reassured Ms Anderson that there are no concerning features in the history or examination to suggest a sinister cause for her left occipital headache or her paraesthesias in the left arm. The fact that she has had a contrast enhanced CT scan of the brain which has shown entirely stable appearances with no new pathology is even more reassuring. With regard to the headache, there are no features consistent with migraine and the time course is far too long for this. I have therefore advised her not to take any further doses of Sumatriptan. The headache is non-specific and has had a partial response to paracetamol. I advised that the headache is more likely to respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen or Nurofen) and a couple of doses of such medications are unlikely to worsen her reflux disease, especially as she is taking omeprazole cover. She should not take more than a few doses as otherwise she will be at risk of medication-overuse reinforcing her headache and making it worse. With regard to the paraesthesias in the left arm, I could find no objective sensory deficit and therefore I explained to Ms Anderson that the symptoms are subjective and likely to be psychologically mediated, most likely as a result of the recent deterioration in her mood. Ms Anderson understood this. I advised that with improvement of her mood and stress levels I expect that the paraesthesias in the left arm will gradually disappear. I discussed her case with Dr Stanton who agreed with my assessment and recommendations above. I have discharged Ms Anderson from further follow up in this clinic.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nElectronically checked\\n\\nDr James Gratwicke BMBCh MRCP\\nSpecialist Registrar in Neurology to Dr Biba Stanton, Consultant Neurologist\\nCc.

Resective surgery of right temporal lobe abnormality for cortical dysplasia in January 2001 and again June 2001.  Became seizure free after the second operation and was able to wean off her treatment completely by 2002. Recurrence around the age of 15 years.\\n\\nPrevious AEDs: Clonazepam, Carbamazepine, Valproate, Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam April 2013 (not tolerated).  Dr Hughes\\x92s first letter also mentions Topiramate (but not clear if taken). Ask next time if there were any others.\\n\\nInvestigations: MRI head February 2016: Unchanged from scan of MRI of 24thFebruary 2012. Right anterior temporal resection sparing the superior part of the right superior temporal gyrus and the most anterior aspect of the right middle frontal gyrus and extending to involve the amygdala, uncus, and head and body of the hippocampus. There is a small residual tail of hippocampus remaining, without signal change. There is some gliotic change extending around the lateral margin of the right ventricular atrium. \\n\\nEEG February 2016: Continuous irregular sharpened slow activity appears over the right mid and posterior temporal region with frequent sharp waves seen intermixed. These findings are in keeping with the previous right temporal resection and suggestive of focal onset seizures arising from that area. \\n\\nI reviewed Gabriella in clinic today.  She attended with her mother. She was unable to tolerate the higher dose of Lacosamide because it gave her side effects (she felt dizzy).  She therefore continues on the same dose as last time as follows.\\nMedication:\\n\\nLacosamide 150 mg twice a day, dose reached January 2017.  No side effect on this dose but had side effects when she tried 200 mg.\\n\\nMicrogynon\\n\\nStopped other supplements\\n\\nShe takes the Lacosamide around 6 am and about 6:30 in the evening.  Although she may have a seizure in the day her mother reports that she has more seizures early evening.\\n\\nSeizures: Gabriella estimates about two seizures a month.  These involve her going blank for up to 5 minutes with another 5 minutes of recovery.  She can drop what she is holding but she tends to maintain posture although she goes stiff.\\n\\nPlan:\\n\\nBecause Lacosamide has generally suited her, I would like to try again to optimise this further.  Rather than increase the dose twice daily, I suggest she adds a dose in the middle of the day. She will continue on the 150mg in the morning and evening as she is doing now but add another 50 mg in the day, if tolerated, which could be later increased further if she has further seizures and if she has no side-effects. Thank you for changing her prescription to allow for this increase.\\n\\nI asked for an appointment in my clinic for six months but I will also ask the nurses to try and book another telephone consultation half way in between.  If they can book it for a Wednesday, it is her day off and she is more likely to be able to respond.\\nYours sincerely \\n\\nChecked Electronically\\nDr Nashef MD FRCP\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nCc\\n\\nCathy Queally/Debbie Miller\\n\\nDear Cathy/Debbie\\n\\nI would be very grateful if you would kindly book a telephone consultation for Gabriella on a Wednesday, if possible, as this is the day that she is able to respond.

He attended with his parents.  They have not made any changes since they saw Dr Mantoan last year.  I have had an update from Gary in Smeeth Hill House Smeeth Ashford.  This was helpful.  He continues to have usually almost daily seizures although occasionally his mother noted that he has gone a few days without any.  She also noted that more severe seizures sometimes are followed by a gap in between.  Gary mentioned in her letter that they have tried to make the environment as safe as possible for him.  A main concern is that he has between one and three falls a month with the seizures.  This put him at risk of injury.\\n\\nPlan:\\n\\nThey would like to try again reducing topiramateas the previous reduction had gone well.  He will reduce to 100mg in the morning 50 at lunch time and 150 in evening.  If that does not work then they will change to 100 three times a day or reverse the reduction.  The other medication will remain the same.  I have again offered Perampanel as an add-on medication.  I appreciate that he has ended up on so many AEDs.  Perampanel has a different mechanism of action and although the chances of improvement remain small they are not negligible.  It can be associated with giddiness, mood disturbance, irritability and weight gain.  It has a very long half life.  They will consider it and let me know.  I have asked for a routine appointment in clinic.  I will also ask my secretary to make an appointment around February and his parents may see if Gary could accompany him so that we could include him in the discussion.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nSent without signing to avoid delay \\nDr Nashef MD FRCP\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr L Nashef MD FRCP\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8347\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8341\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered on 10 November 2016 by Cheryl Straughan (Medical Secretary)\\nPage 1 of 2 \\n\\nDuncan Rogers F191648 NHS No:6341889542\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

He is inevitably very sedated first thing in the morning and it takes him some time to be functioning normally.

I was sorry to hear that she is having major convulsions approximately every two weeks.  She described episodes that occur with no warning and she has no recollection of them.  Her partner describes they can happen in any circumstances, start with a loud vocalisation, she then falls and will begin jerking.  Her eyes are open but may blink in time with jerking.  She may turn blue, and develops loud stertorous breathing.  She is then confused afterwards, and sometimes this confusion includes aggression and is difficult to manage.\\n\\nI think it is highly likely these are generalised tonic clonic seizures with difficult postictal confusion.\\n\\nMs Stroud told me that she is currently living in an extremely stressful situation with a neighbour.  She showed me an injury on her leg which she alleged was due to an assault from her neighbour.  Apparently this is a situation that her GP and MP are both familiar with.  Epilepsy is often exacerbated by stress, and severe prolonged stress like this is likely to be a major problem for her.  Of course an obvious solution would be for her to be able to move away from this situation.\\n\\nWe talked about her medications.  Currently she is taking Sodium Valproate 1100 mg twice daily and Carbamazepine 100 mg twice daily.  In some instances, Carbamazepine can make idiopathic generalised epilepsy worse, so we agreed that she would reduce this to 100 mg once daily for two weeks and then stop altogether.  Simultaneously, she should increase her Sodium Valproate to 1100 mg in the morning and 1500 mg in the evening for two weeks, and then to 1500 mg twice daily.  Therefore she would continue on Sodium Valproate alone, and will stop Carbamazepine.\\n\\nShe knows to be in touch if she is running into any difficulties on 0283 299 8331, otherwise I will see her in four months.\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nReviewed electronically\\nProf Richardson MA PhD FRCP\\nPaul Getty III Professor of Epilepsy\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\n\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor Mark Richardson MA PhD FRCP?Paul Getty III Professor of Epilepsy\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8352\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\n\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTyped on 29 August 2019 by R Isatou Lovelace (Secretary)\\nPage 1 of 1 \\n\\nSuzanne Stroud   V004107[PAT_NHSNo]\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

Unfortunately the epileptic attacks are much worse, sometimes as many as two or three times per day.  There were no obvious trigger factors and no clear reason why the attacks have become more frequent.  The patient has suffered a number of bruises during the epileptic attacks.  Her behaviour is fine and there are no obvious hallucinations.  The patient had blood tests performed in May 2014 which are generally okay although her MCV continues to be raised at 105.8 and the neutrophil count is also low at 1.60.  As you know she did see the haematologists seven or eight years ago with similar blood test results.  We will need to continue to monitor these blood tests.\\n\\nThe patient\\x92s antiepileptic medication has recently been increased and she is now taking Lamotrigine 150 mg bd. and Topiramate 200 mg bd.  There are no side effects from the increased dose of medication.  We need a period of time to see whether the attacks settle down on these increased doses of medication.  If that is not the case she will need a new agent such as Sodium Valproate initially 100 mg bd. increasing after one week to 200 mg bd. and then switching to the slow release formulation at a dose of 300 mg bd.  I would only start the Sodium Valproate if it is clear that the attacks are continuing despite the increased dose of her existing medication.  \\n\\nI will ask our Epilepsy Nurse, Walter Loudon to review her and I will review the patient again in due course.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\n\\nDr Weeks PhD FRCP\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\n\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr Robert Weeks PhD FRCP\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8335\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered on 03 September 2014 by Nma Nzekwu (Secretary)\\nPage 1 of 1 \\n\\nOmolara Odamo   D650972 NHS No: 6226130237\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

Her MRI was finally done under general anaesthesia and shows a small area of encephalomalacia in the left inferior frontal gyrus.

There was no other abnormality and in particular no evidence of vasculitic lesions or increased signal in the medial temporal areas to suggest a limbic encephalits.  Her antithyroid antibodies were slightly raised at 151 (0-60 units/ml).  Her other antibody screening including anti LGI1, nuclear antibodies, NMDA receptor antibodies and voltage gaited potassium channel antibodies were all normal.  Her cardiolipin antibody IgM was slightly raised at 11 (normal range up to 10).

He attended alone.  \\nHe reports things have been okay since he last saw us two years ago.  His mum keeps a record of his seizures, which he thinks have been exclusively nocturnal over the past 3 years.  He thinks that he is getting less than 5 seizures a month and that they are mostly explained by missing drug doses or by alcohol intake.   He continues to smoke cigarettes but not marijuana.  He thinks that when he doesn\\x92t miss medication, his seizures are controlled and on this basis we haven\\x92t made any changes today.   However we did discuss the small risk to life during uncontrolled seizures, especially at night, and the importance of not missing doses of medication.  \\n\\nPreviously our records indicate he was on Keppra 1500 mg twice a day and Tegretol Slow Release previously 400 mg twice a day.  He doesn\\x92t think doses have changed but couldn\\x92t be sure.  \\nHe raised the issue of driving and is keen to pursue a driving license, partly because it would serve as a form of ID.  We did discuss the driving regulations and that if he has been seizure free while awake (i.e. all his seizures have occurred at night, while sleeping) for 3 years then the DVLA would likely consider him eligible.  In the first instance I have asked him to check with his mum and relatives that he hasn\\x92t had any seizures at all while awake in the last 3 years, and then make contact with the DVLA and they would probably ask us for more information.  \\n\\nDr Nashef subsequently joined us and we have agreed on the following plan\\n\\nPlan\\n\\n· No change to AEDs\\n· Follow-up in 12 months in this clinic, with 6 month follow-up in epilepsy CNS clinic\\n· I will ask our epilepsy pharmacist to liaise with you to see if we can simplify medication supply to try and reduce the number of missed doses.   \\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically signed\\nDr D Ahrabian \\n\\nNeurology SpR to Dr Nashef\\n\\nCC \\x96 Kai-Loke Chan, Pharmacist, KCH \\x96 Dear Kai, Dr Nashef asked me to contact you for your help with this patient.  I wonder if you could explore the current situation.  He has mild LD and has a dosset box for his AEDs, however he sometimes misses doses due to difficulty in arranging regular prescriptions.  Is there anything we can do, in conjunction with his GP, to help with this?

According to a friend who was with her, who is a nurse, she became vacant.  She herself is unable to remember much more.  The friend said that she was staring and able to answer questions but was quite vague.  This continued for about 15 minutes, during which time, she thinks the palpitations were continuing.  Her friend then walked her towards the door to get some fresh air and while they were walking, she became weak and fell on to her friend.  She then was laid down on to the ground where her eyes were flickering and hands trembling.  This lasted 20 seconds and occurred three times, separated each time by her opening her eyes and taking a deep breath.\\n\\nAn ambulance arrived and she came round.  She was at that point orientated and is able to remember but remembers not being sure why she was on the floor.  For about five hours, she was slow to think and had a headache and for the next two days felt exhausted. \\n\\nShe has fainted in a hot place twice before, but nothing similar to this.  There were no obvious triggers, although she had been out the night before.  She is otherwise well.\\n\\nPast medical history: \\n\\nNil.\\n\\nMedication:\\n\\nOral contraceptive pill\\n\\nSocial history:\\n\\nMs Fitzmaurice smokes 10 cigarettes a day.  She drinks three units a week on average.  She is a nurse and lives with two friends.\\n\\nFamily History:\\n\\nHer father is 62 and has asthma.  Her mother is 59 and has multiple sclerosis.  She is the youngest of four siblings, having three older brothers.  There is no family history of similar symptoms.\\n\\nExamination:\\n\\nA detailed neurological examination was normal.  Specifically optic discs were normal and reflexes symmetrical.\\n\\nOpinion:\\n\\nMs Fitzmaurice is a 26 -year-old woman with an episode of loss of consciousness following about five minutes of palpitations and appearing vague.  A possibility is that she had a cardiac arrhythmia with consequent hypotension; she then stood up to walk but suffered a hypotensive loss of consciousness with a consequent hypoxic seizure.  Another possibility is that the entire episode was epileptic in nature as primary epilepsy can cause cardiac arrhythmias.\\n\\nSuggested Management:\\n\\nIn the first instance, therefore, to try to disentangle these two possibilities, I have arranged a 24-hour ECG, an EEG, and an MRI brain.  A CT head scan is previously reported as normal.  I have therefore arranged the MRI brain with an epilepsy protocol.  I will also refer her to the cardiologists for their opinion.  \\n\\nShe does not currently drive except in Ireland, and knows not to drive until the diagnosis is known. \\nWe will see her again in two months\\x92 time.  \\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically checked\\n\\nProfessor Ammar Al-Chalabi PhD FRCP DipStat\\nProfessor of Neurology & Complex Disease Genetics\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\n\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor A Al-Chalabi PhD FRCP DipStat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8355\\n\\nEmail:    kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppointments:        020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax:  020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTyped on 08 March 2017 by Lei Tsang (Medical Secretary)\\nPage 1 of 2 \\n\\nRoisin Fitzmaurice R123935 NHS No: 7106153494\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)\\n\\n2. Epilepsy\\n\\n3. 17 weeks pregnant with her 1st child.\\nMedication:\\n\\nNone - Stopped Lamotrigine \\n\\nKatie and her mum were seen in the nurse epilepsy clinic today at the request of Ruskin Midwives as Katie is pregnant with her first baby. \\n\\nDr Mahdi-Rogers , Consultant Neurologist had prescribed Lamotrigine in February 2018 and Katie had increased to 25mg twice a day but felt sick reduced it back to 25mg daily and then stopped it completely. It is not clear when she stopped taking Lamotrigine but Katie had discovered she was pregnant. Katie and d her mum confirm no seizures with her last seizure was possibly in November 2017 but they are not sure. \\n\\nI note she is not taking Folic Acid 5mg daily. \\n\\nToday we discussed the risks of seizure activity and epilepsy medication to a developing baby. Katie and her mum were already aware of the potential teratogenicity of anti-epileptics as discussed at her last appointment with Dr Mahdi-Rogers. \\n\\nAny woman considering having a baby has a background risk of 1% to 2% of any fetal abnormality, exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increases the risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) to 4% and 9% risk depending upon the drug and dose taken, this has to be balanced against the possibility of seizures happening during pregnancy which may also affect a developing baby or the safety of the mother.\\n\\nis presently taking one AED at a low dose but it does have a risk of congenital malformations. We discussed the benefits of taking Folic acid 5mgs before she becomes pregnant as folate has been shown to reduce the frequency of neural tube defects in the general population. \\n\\nKatie is aware that she will need regular monitoring during her pregnancy. She needs to be make sure lifestyle is regular and that she minimises any other risk factors.  She is aware that major malformations can be screened for, with the option of terminating the pregnancy, but more minor malformations would not picked up on screening, Pregnancy may have no effect on her epilepsy control, others may find that the seizures improve or it may worsen and again she would be monitored more regularly. \\n\\nAfter discussion today Katie is happy to recommence Lamotrigine but cannot take the tablet versions so would need the dispersible version.\\n\\n Dr Mahdi-Rogers has recommended the following: \\n\\nPlan:\\n1) Lamotrigine 25mg dispersible daily for two weeks.\\n\\nIf no side effects then increase to 25mg twice a day.\\n\\nThen to review if dose needs to be increased further.\\n2) To commence Folic Acid 5mg daily (is taking pregnancy vitamins). \\n\\n3) Katie will require monthly pre-dose lamotrigine blood levels (on the day of the blood test Katie should not her morning dose until the blood sample has been taken then to take the dose as soon as she can). \\n\\n4) The dose of lamotrigine may need to increased depending upon the blood level etc. Katie is aware that the Lamotrigine blood level can be reduced during pregnancy in some women. \\nI have given Katie and her mum written information from Epilepsy Action and Society detailing information regarding conception, risk of abnormalities, affect during pregnancy, delivery and baby care. I also discussed the UK epilepsy & pregnancy Register, she is aware she can contact them via www.epilepsyandpregnancy.co.uk or Tel no: 0800 389 1248 to join the registrar and to seek further information regarding pregnancy, fetal abnormalities and epilepsy drugs.\\n\\nKatie has an outpatient appointment with Dr Mahdi-Rogers on the 10th July 2018 and follow up with me will be a combination of telephone and clinic appointments alternating with the midwifery team. \\n\\nThank you for prescribing the Lamotrigine and Folic Acid 5mg. \\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nChecked electronically\\n\\nCathy Queally\\n\\nEpilepsy CNS \\n\\ncc \\n\\nDr Mohamed Mahdi-Rogers MD MRCP\\n\\nConsultant Neurologist\\n\\nKCH\\n\\nDenmark Hill\\r\\n\\nLondon\\r\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\r\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nCathy Queally & Debbie Miller\\r\\n\\nEpilepsy Specialist Nurses\\r\\n\\nDirect Line: 020 3299 8340\\r\\n\\n                  020 3299 8331\\r\\n\\nEmail: ï¿½ HYPERLINK \"mailto:cathy.queally@nhs.net\" ï¿½cathy.queally@nhs.netï¿½\\r\\n\\n           ï¿½ HYPERLINK \"mailto:debbiemiller1@nhs.net\" ï¿½debbiemiller1@nhs.netï¿½\\r\\n\\nkch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\r\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\r\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8341\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\nTyped on 22 June 2018 by Cathy Queally (Epilepsy CNS)\\n\\nPage 2 of 2 \\n\\nKatie Davenport V323185 NHS No: 4409676792\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

He reports that since January 2018 he has had two episodes one early in January after the party season when \\x91exhausted\\x92 and had had some alcohol before.  The other episode was also at a time when he felt exhausted.  They only lasted five seconds.  One of episodes was witnessed by his reflexologist, the other by his wife. He tells me he has had blood tests and that his gamma GT remains elevated but similar to previous readings.  He reports that he is keeping his alcohol down.\\nPlan: He will try an increase in Levetiracetam by 250 mg in the evening.  If that goes well with no side effects (more tiredness or any mood disturbance, anxiety or depression), then he has the option of increasing the morning as well so that he takes 750mg twice a day. I will see him again next year but I have also asked for an appointment with the epilepsy nurses in November.

Follow-up routinely\\n\\nIt was a pleasure to review Rosemary in clinic today with Cathy Queally in our joint VNS Clinic.  Rosemary came accompanied by her carer and her driver.  I received various letters from the Epilepsy Nurse and from her mother asking a variety of questions and highlighting some previous issues.  Here are our answers.\\n\\nFirstly, the reduction in Lamotrigine due to concerns regarding her mobility have not only improved her mobility but also made Rosemary very much brighter.  This has now resulted in some behavioural issues with her screaming, throwing things around.  These behaviours are not related to the pre or postictal period.  I do think that these is her natural behaviour and natural character that is coming out as the sedation is being lessened.  I do not think these behavioural side effects are necessarily related to Valproate, and a Lamotrigine decrease would not necessarily change her Valproate levels.\\n\\nA further worry has been weight gain.  She has been on Valproate for quite a while and Valproate levels are not altered by reducing Lamotrigine, so I don\\x92t think Valproate levels are the cause of her weoght gain.  I hear that her oral contraceptive pill had been changed and weight gain was noticed since she was started on a new pill.  She has now been put back on Microgynon and I think we should see how things go.\\n\\nOverall, I have been asked whether I think this represents a deterioration of her Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and whether she requires a repeat CT scan.  I think behaviourally she is much brighter and her seizures have remained quite stable (: She averages about 10-53 seizures a month predominantly tonic seizures and tonic clonic seizures).  Usually Lennox-Gastaut type patients do not deteriorate a lot in their adult years as unfortunately what is lost is normally lost earlier on.  A CT would certainly not be of any help and I do not think that there is any reason for an MRI.  \\nI do think that the behaviours need to be managed by the Community Learning Disability Team and I would be grateful if you could refer her on to them.  \\nIn terms of her seizure management, should seizures increase, Valproate can be increased by 200 mg to a total dose of 1000 mg bd.  This may have a positive effect on her mood as well.\\n\\nIn terms of VNS management, she requires a battery replacement and we will put her on the waiting list for it.  We have given her information for the heart rate responsive device and so she can decide whether she would like to try a new device when the battery is replaced.  We will see her routinely in this clinic and the VNS settings are detailed in Cathy Quelly\\x92s separate letter.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically signed\\nDr Mantoan \\n\\n\\n\\n&\\nCathy Queally\\nLocum Consultant Neurologist\\n\\nEpilepsy Nurse Specialist \\n\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDr L Nashef MD FRCP\\n\\nCathy Queally: Epilepsy Nurse Specialist\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8347\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\nAppointments:       020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax: 020 3299 8341\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered on 17 December 2015 by Cheryl Straughan (Medical Secretary)\\nPage 2 of 2 \\n\\nRosemary Ward Z001581 NHS No:4305978563\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

There have also been cardiac problems and postural hypotension for which the patient sees Dr Nick Gall.\\n\\nOver the last two to three years there have been neurological episodes which have been interpreted as seizures.  Although the patient was previously assessed by the Epilepsy Service it does not appear that the patient tolerated detailed neurological investigation.  He was, however, tried on Levetiracetam and Valproate but both of these apparently caused unacceptable side effects.\\n\\nOver the last few months the patient has had increasingly frequent \\x93twitches\\x94 and episodes when the arms may elevate in a dystonic fashion.  On occasions the patient has collapsed to the floor.  These episodes occur most mornings often several times in the morning.  There have been no recent generalised tonic clonic seizures although I understand the patient did have a single generalised tonic clonic seizure following a head injury about two years ago.\\n\\nThe patient\\x92s current medication includes Omeprazole 10 mg daily and Memantine 10 mg b.d. as well as Fludrocortisone.\\n\\nOn examination today there were occasional \\x93twitches\\x94 of the upper limbs.  There was limited communication and no speech.  He appeared to be aware of others around him.  He walked into the clinic.\\n\\nThe neurological problem is therefore that of intermittent upper limb twitching and jerks in a 54-year-old man with Down syndrome and Alzheimer\\x92s (I understand that up until 2009 he was communicating and living in supported accommodation but travelling independently on public transport).  I suspect that the neurological episodes are epileptic, presumably some form of brief myoclonic seizure.  The usual treatment would be Valproate or Levetiracetam.\\n\\nAlthough one might consider other antiepileptic medications, I thought that there would be a case for trying Valproate again at a low dose starting at 50 mg twice a day.  This could be by tablet or by syrup.  If the lower dose of Valproate is tolerated then one might consider increasing the dosage according to response.\\n\\nValproate would, of course, have potential for causing an increased appetite and weight again and this would need to be monitored carefully.  I shall review the patient again in four months.\\n\\nWith best wishes\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically checked\\nDr T C Britton \\n\\nConsultant Neurologist\\nDr Tom Britton\\n\\nConsultant Neurologist\\n\\n\\n\\nNeurology Department \\n\\nKing\\x92s College Hospital\\n\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLONDON\\n\\nSE5 9RS \\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary: Margaret Gorman\\n\\nPhone: 020 3299 1029\\n\\nFax: 020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail: kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\nAppointments: 020 3299 1919\\n\\nMain Hospital Phone: 020 3299 9000\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTyped on 10 June 2015 by Judi Westfallen (Personal Assistant)\\nPage 2 of 2 \\n\\nGraham Young F116577\\n\\n\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",

She suffered a generalised tonic clonic seizure on the ward and was started on Valproate 100 mg b.d.  She was diagnosed with a left hemispheric TIA and discharged with investigations and follow-up.  In February she had three episodes of similar symptoms lasting for half an hour and she was switched to dual antiplatelet therapy.  A CTA was abnormal and queried a left subclavian steal.  Doppler imaging showed a right ICA stenosis of 30-40%, nil on the left but subclavian stenosis with a possibility of subclavian steal syndrome.  This was reviewed in April by the vascular surgeons who felt that she did not clinically have subclavian steal syndrome and suggested repeat carotid and subclavian scan in six months\\x92 time and mono-therapy.\\nToday she tells me that two days ago she had 15-minute episode of very similar symptoms with right upper limb and lower limb weakness and sensory loss and three days ago she had a five-minute episode which fully resolved.  This is on top of two episodes last week.  She gives a good story of the right arm and leg weakness, worsening of her right facial droop and sensory loss in her face.\\n\\nOn a separate note, in September she presented to A&E with a generalised tonic clonic seizure.  Her valproate level was noted to be less than 3.  Her valproate dose have not seem to have been increased since her discharge in January and a gradual increase to 300 mg b.d. was advised.  On discharge she is on a dose of 200 mg a.m., 100 mg p.m.  Unfortunately Mrs Healy does not know what dose of drug she takes.  She did not bring her medication in today and has only got the discharge summary from early September.  It is unclear whether her dose of Valproate has been increased or not.  She has not had any further seizures.  Her last seizure was in January on the ward following her TIAs.\\n\\nOn examination there were no new findings beyond the existing right fifth, sixth, seventh (LMN) and eighth cranial nerve palsies.  She was unsteady on her feet and walked with a stick. She is hypertensive at 173/96 with a heart rate of 92.\\nImpression:\\n\\nMrs Healy has recurrent TIA syndromes with a known subclavian stenosis and queried subclavian steal syndrome.  She may be on a sub-therapeutic dose of Valproate.  It is unclear what dose she is currently on. \\nI am concerned about the frequent recurrence of her TIA syndromes and have spoken to the stroke team to see if she can be investigated today for her symptoms.  \\nI have requested an ECG which shows sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular ectopics and have requested a 24-hour tape.  \\nCould you please confirm the Valproate dose and increase it as per our previous letter.  Please monitor and treat her blood pressure.  I see she has an EEG booked on 13th October.  I will review her in clinic with the results of these investigations in three months\\x92 time.\\n\\nYours sincerely\\n\\nElectronically checked\\n\\nDr Cristina Koppel \\n\\nNeurology Registrar\\n\\nP.S:  I have discussed Mrs Healey\\x92s case with Dr Weeks, the Stroke Consultant who is happy to arrange outpatient urgent MRI and Dopplers in the coming week and this will be reviewed by the stroke team.\\nDenmark Hill\\n\\nLondon\\n\\nSE5 9RS\\n\\n\\n\\nTel:   020 3299 9000\\n\\nFax:  020 3299 3445\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor A Al-Chalabi PhD FRCP DipStat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecretary: 020 3299 8335\\n\\nEmail:    kch-tr.neurologysecretaries@nhs.net\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppointments:        020 3299 1919\\n\\nDepartmental Fax:  020 3299 8358\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTyped on 08 October 2015 by Nma Nzekwu (Secretary)\\nPage 2 of 3 \\n\\nMargaret Healey P734856 NHS No: 4022922419\\n\\nAll personal information are not true, so they are not sensitive.\\n\\nDoes the patient has the following symptoms: \\'anxiety\\',\\'depression\\', \\'dizziness\\', \\'headache\\', \\'lethargy\\', \\'nausea\\', \\'rash\\'.\\n\\nDo not try to make up an answer, please answer my question in the following JSON format:\\n[\\n    \"anxiety\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"depression\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"dizziness\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"headache\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"lethargy\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"nausea\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n    \"rash\":\"True\" or \"False\",\\n]\\n\\n',\n",
